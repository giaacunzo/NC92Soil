## Abstract

The extensive evaluation of the impact of local seismo-stratigraphic configurations on seismic ground motion
presents significant challenges due to the necessity of considering the combined effects of uncertainty and small-
scale lateral variability of the relevant parameters. To effectively explore these sources of uncertainty, a new
Python-based computer program is proposed for one-dimensional seismic site response simulations, adopting the
equivalent linear viscoelastic approach in the frequency domain. With respect to existing software, the code
introduces new pre- and post-processing features, which also meet the specific requirements of seismic microzonation
studies. Within the code, the complete spectrum of uncertainties related to local seismo-stratigraphic
configurations, including lithotype successions, layer thicknesses, and seismic and geotechnical properties for
the considered lithotypes, is managed by considering user-defined constraints and statistical properties of the
relevant parameters. Additionally, a batch approach is offered, enabling the application of the procedure to an
unlimited number of different scenarios. To demonstrate the potentiality of the proposed code, a comprehensive
set of 90,000 local seismic site response analyses was conducted, showing a clear correlation between the
amplification factors, the mean shear wave velocity in the upper 30 m, the fundamental frequency of the deposit
and the depth to the seismic bedrock.
